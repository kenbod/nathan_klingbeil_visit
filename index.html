        <p>The inability of incoming students to advance past the
traditional freshman calculus sequence is a primary cause of attrition
in engineering programs across the country. This presentation will
describe an NSF funded initiative at Wright State University to redefine
the way engineering mathematics is taught, with the goal of increasing
student retention, motivation and success in engineering.</p>

<p>The Wright State approach begins with the development of
a novel first-year engineering mathematics course, EGR 101, called
<q>Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications.</q> Taught by
engineering faculty, the course includes lecture, laboratory and
recitation components. Using an application-oriented, hands-on
approach, the course addresses only the salient math topics actually
used in core engineering courses. These include the traditional
physics, engineering mechanics, electric circuits and computer
programming sequences. The EGR 101 course replaces traditional math
prerequisite requirements for the above core engineering courses, so
that students can begin advancing in the engineering curriculum
without first completing the required calculus sequence.
The Wright State model concludes with a more just-in-time
structuring of the traditional math sequence, still taught by the math
department, in concert with College and ABET requirements. The result
has shifted the traditional emphasis on math prerequisite requirements
to an emphasis on engineering motivation for math.</p>

<p>This presentation will
provide an overview of the Wright State model for engineering
mathematics education, followed by a longitudinal assessment of its
impact on student performance, perception, and retention from
first-year through graduation. Results of a
longitudinal study suggest that the introduction of EGR 101 and
associated prerequisite changes have successfully mitigated the effect
of incoming math preparation on student success in engineering across
the entire range of incoming ACT math scores, which has more than
doubled the average graduation rate of enrolled students. For
underrepresented students, the difference was a factor of three. As
part of our NSF STEP Type 1 and CCLI Phase 3 initiatives, various
aspects of the approach have been adopted by dozens of institutions
across the country (primarily university, but also at the community
college and K-12 levels).</p>

<p>Dr. Nathan Klingbeil is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Dean
of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State
University (Dayton, OH). He received his Ph.D. in Mechanical
Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 1998. Prior to joining
the Wright State faculty, he worked as a Materials Research Engineer
at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing
Directorate.</p>

<p>Dr. Klingbeil is the lead investigator for Wright State's
National Model for Engineering Mathematics Education, which has been
supported by over $5.0M in grants from the National Science
Foundation. Prior to his appointment as Dean, he served as Associate
Dean for Academic affairs from 2010-2013, as Director of Student
Retention and Success from 2007-2009, and held the University title of
Robert J. Kegerreis Distinguished Professor of Teaching from
2005-2008. Dr. Klingbeil has received numerous awards for his work in
engineering education, and was named the 2005 Ohio Professor of the
Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and
Council for Advancement and Support of Education.</p>
